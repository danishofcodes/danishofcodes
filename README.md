### 🎯 Future Goals

I aim to contribute to open source projects, because I feel that its imperative to give back to the dev community as much as I have gotten (and am still getting) to learn from them, their problems, their codes and their documentations each and everyday. In that way I believe I'll be able expand my knowledge in developing softwares and modern applications.

Feel free to connect with me!
